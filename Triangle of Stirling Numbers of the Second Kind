# Question 1-star: Stirling and Bell Numbers

# The number of ways of splitting n items in k non-empty sets is called
# the Stirling number, S(n,k), of the second kind. For example, the group 
# of people Dave, Sarah, Peter and Andy could be split into two groups in 
# the following ways.

# 1.   Dave, Sarah, Peter         Andy
# 2.   Dave, Sarah, Andy          Peter
# 3.   Dave, Andy, Peter          Sarah
# 4.   Sarah, Andy, Peter         Dave
# 5.   Dave, Sarah                Andy, Peter
# 6.   Dave, Andy                 Sarah, Peter
# 7.   Dave, Peter                Andy, Sarah

# so S(4,2) = 7

# If instead we split the group into one group, we have just one way to 
# do it.

# 1. Dave, Sarah, Peter, Andy

# so S(4,1) = 1

# or into four groups, there is just one way to do it as well

# 1. Dave        Sarah          Peter         Andy

# so S(4,4) = 1

# If we try to split into more groups than we have people, there are no
# ways to do it.

# The formula for calculating the Stirling numbers is

#  S(n, k) = k*S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)

# Furthermore, the Bell number B(n) is the number of ways of splitting n 
# into any number of parts, that is,

# B(n) is the sum of S(n,k) for k =1,2, ... , n.

# Write two procedures, stirling and bell. The first procedure, stirling 
# takes as its inputs two positive integers of which the first is the 
# number of items and the second is the number of sets into which those 
# items will be split. The second procedure, bell, takes as input a 
# positive integer n and returns the Bell number B(n).

def stirling(items, sets):
    if items == sets or sets == 1:
		return 1
    elif sets > items:
		return 0
    else:
		ways = (sets*stirling(items-1, sets)) + stirling(items-1, sets-1)
    return ways

# B(n) is the sum of S(n,k) for k =1,2, ... , n.
def bell(num):
	bell = 0
	for i in range(num):
		bell += stirling(num, i+1)
	return bell
